# DarkForge

DarkForge is a password analysis and generation toolkit designed for security research and penetration testing purposes.

## Overview

This project uses OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) data to generate potential password candidates based on common patterns and user information. It's intended for authorized security testing and research only.

## Features

- Collect comprehensive user profile data
- Generate password candidates using advanced pattern algorithms
- Transform passwords using common substitution patterns

## Project Structure

- `modules/`: Core functionality modules
  - `data_input/`: User data collection and processing
  - `pattern_generator.py`: Password generation algorithms
- `interfaces/`: User interface components
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `data/`: Data storage
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To collect user data and generate passwords:

```python
from darkforge.modules.data_input.collector import UserProfile, get_user_profile
from darkforge.modules.pattern_generator import generate_passwords

# Collect user data interactively
profile_data = get_user_profile(source="cli")
profile = UserProfile(**profile_data)

# Generate password candidates
passwords = generate_passwords(profile)
```
